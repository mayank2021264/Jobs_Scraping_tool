Location: Bengaluru, Karnataka, India

Experience: 0–2 years

We are a forward-thinking technology company at the forefront of Edge AI innovation, developing intelligent solutions that run efficiently on low-power, resource-constrained devices. Our mission is to bring AI closer to where data is generated—making devices smarter, faster, and more autonomous in real-world applications.

Role Overview:
We are seeking a passionate and driven Jr. Edge AI Engineer to join our cutting-edge AI team in Bengaluru. This role is ideal for fresh graduates or junior professionals with a strong background in image-based data processing, machine learning, and embedded systems. You will be working on real-world applications of computer vision and deep learning models deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. This is a hands-on opportunity to contribute to the complete AI pipeline, from image data annotation and model training to on-device deployment and optimization.

Key Responsibilities:
• Participate in the end-to-end AI pipeline with a focus on image-based datasets: data collection, cleaning, annotation, preprocessing, and augmentation.
• Assist in designing, training, and evaluating deep learning models for image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
• Experiment with CNN architectures, image-based transformers, and lightweight vision models
• Contribute to model compression and optimization (quantization, pruning) for real-time inference on edge devices.
• Work with edge AI toolkits (e.g., TensorFlow Lite, OpenVINO, ONNX) to deploy models to devices such as Raspberry Pi, NVIDIA Jetson, or ARM-based microcontrollers.
• Collaborate with hardware and firmware teams to ensure seamless integration of AI models with embedded platforms.
• Write clean, efficient, and modular code in Python, C++, and C for AI application development.
• Conduct model validation and accuracy testing on live edge devices using camera-based input.
• Stay updated with the latest trends and research in Edge AI, TinyML, and computer vision for embedded platforms.
• Assist in the creation of technical documentation, model deployment guides, and demo showcases.

Required Qualifications & Skills:
Bachelor's or master's degree in Computer Science, Electronics, AI/ML, or related field.
Strong grasp of machine learning and deep learning fundamentals, especially in image-based data.
Experience with DL frameworks like TensorFlow, PYTORCH, or Keras.
Familiarity with image processing tools and libraries such as OpenCV.
Hands-on experience with data annotation tools (e.g., CVAT, LabelImg).
Ability to train and evaluate deep learning models using image datasets.
Proficiency in Python and C++. Familiarity with C in embedded contexts is a plus.
Exposure to edge devices and deployment environments.
Understanding of hardware constraints in embedded platforms and techniques to optimize AI models accordingly.
Knowledge of version control systems (e.g., Git).
Preferred (Nice to Have) Skills:
Experience working on object detection, segmentation, or tracking tasks.
Exposure to real-time camera input processing on edge platforms.
Knowledge of TensorRT, OpenVINO, TFLite, or ONNX Runtime.
Familiarity with edge AI platforms like NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Coral Edge TPU, or Raspberry Pi.
Experience with embedded Linux, serial protocols (SPI, I2C, UART), and GPIO-based interactions.
Understanding of model optimization methods for edge deployment.
Exposure to MLOps, TinyML, or automated deployment pipelines.
Experience with containerization (Docker) is a plus.
What We Offer:
A dynamic, innovative work environment on the cutting edge of Edge AI.
Real-world projects with tangible impact.
Mentorship from AI and embedded systems.
A collaborative, learning-focused team culture.
Continuous professional development and growth opportunities.

We believe in shaping the future of intelligent devices.
